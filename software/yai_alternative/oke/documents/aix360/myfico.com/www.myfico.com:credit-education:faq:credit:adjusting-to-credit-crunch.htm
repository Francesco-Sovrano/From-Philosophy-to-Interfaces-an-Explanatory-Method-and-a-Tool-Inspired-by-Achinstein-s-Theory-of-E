<h1>What are some other examples of what lenders are doing to limit their risk, and what can I do to adjust to this &quot;credit crunch&quot; so that I'll continue to have a good FICO<sup>®</sup> score?</h1>
<p>Some banks are lowering credit lines and closing accounts that have had little or no recent activity. These actions can hurt your score if they result in higher credit utilization (percentage of balance to credit limit); therefore, you're going to want to preserve your credit lines by keeping your credit card accounts open and using them frequently - while, at the same time, maintaining low balances.</p>
