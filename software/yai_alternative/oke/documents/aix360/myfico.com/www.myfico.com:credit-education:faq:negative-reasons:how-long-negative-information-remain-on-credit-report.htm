<h1>Chapter 7 &amp; 13:How long will negative information remain on my credit report?</h1>
<p>It depends on the type of negative information. Here's the basic breakdown of how long different types of negative information will remain on your credit report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Late payments: 7 years</li>
<li>Bankruptcies: 7 years for completed Chapter 13 bankruptcies and 10 years for Chapter 7 bankruptcies.</li>
<li>Foreclosures: 7 years</li>
<li>Collections: Generally, about 7 years, depending on the age of the debt being collected.</li>
<li>Public Record: 7 years</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Keep in mind:</em><br/>For all of these negative items, the older they are the less impact they are going to have on your FICO<sup>®</sup> score. For example, a collection that is 5 years old will hurt much less than a collection that is 5 months old.</p>
