2-percent rule is: A rule of thumb to see if refinancing a mortgage loan is a good financial decision. The rule says you should refinance if you can lower the interest rate on the loan by at least 2 percentage points (for example, to 7% percent from 9%).

Annual percentage rate (APR) is: The real cost that you pay to borrow, stated as a yearly percentage of the loan amount. This is sometimes called your effective borrowing cost. For auto and mortgage loans, closing costs and discount points are added to calculate APR. For example, if you pay $500 in closing costs to obtain a $10,000 loan, the APR will be higher than the interest rate since you are effectively borrowing $9,500 but will owe $10,000. The Truth-in-Lending Act requires the lender to disclose the APR to you. For credit cards, the annual fee is often not included in the APR calculation. As a result, an APR of a credit card is often its simple interest rate.

</p>

<p>
Budgeting is: A process that starts with creating a plan to record all cash inflows and outflows. The process continues by adhering to a budget.

</p>

<p>
Collection is: Attempted recovery of a past-due credit obligation by a collection department or agency.
</p>

<p>
Comparable-sales method is: Method of using recent sale prices of similar assets to help calculate an appraisal value of an asset. This method is frequently used to appraise residential and commercial real estate. For example, if three homes with similar features in your neighborhood were recently sold, their sale prices would be a fairly reliable indicator of how much your home could sell for today. The timeliness of sales data is also important. For example, in this case, if the sales occurred a year ago, these data may not be reliable indicators of the value of your home today.
</p>

<p>
Compounding is: Adds the interest you earn on an investment and invests it, plus the original investment, for another period. The result is that you earn more interest and a higher rate of return.

<p>
Payment cap is: Limit on the amount that the monthly payment can increase. A periodic cap limits the amount of the increase at each adjustment period. A lifetime cap limits the amount that the monthly payment can increase during the term of the loan. A potential peril of payment caps is negative amortization. In the case of an adjustable-rate mortgage with a payment cap, rising interest rates may cause the loan payment to be insufficient to cover even the interest portion of the scheduled payment. In this case, the unpaid interest may be added to the mortgage loan principal, if the loan agreement permits.
</p>

<p>
Periodic rate cap is: The maximum amount a loan rate can change on an adjustable-rate mortgage loan on the anniversary date. ARM loan rates are often reset once a year after an initial period. A lifetime cap often exists. A lifetime cap limits the maximum loan rate that can be charged.

The value of an asset is stated in dollars (or the appropriate currency). Personal assets include checking and savings accounts, investments, personal property, real estate, collectibles, and the value of life insurance policies. In order to place a value on personal assets, you rely on either market value or appraisal value. For assets that are liquid (i.e., there are many buyers and sellers of the asset or a close substitute), market value is a reliable indicator. For assets that are illiquid (such as a collectible), appraisal value is a more reliable indicator.
</p>

<p>

As part of the budgeting process, you want to save for several months of emergency, or rainy day, expenses. These are funds you can live on for three to six months in the event of an emergency. Part of setting up a personal budget is using it to compare to your actual spending. If you actually spend $1,100 a month and save only $100, you either need to discipline your spending, or adjust your budget to more realistic circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Personal cash flow is: Difference in cash inflows and outflows over a period of time. Calculating your personal cash flow is an essential part of personal budgeting. Cash inflows include salary and other sources of cash-based income. Non-cash compensation is excluded, and you should deduct any contributions to a retirement account.

Major categories of personal liabilities include credit card debt, installment debt, mortgage and home equity debt, and brokerage accounts where you have a margin account.

For example, one point on a loan of $150,000 is $1,500. Lenders consider mortgage points as interest that you pay in advance. As a result, the more points you pay when you close the loan, the lower your interest rate. If you qualify, you may be able to deduct mortgage points in the year you close the loan for tax purposes. Otherwise, you will have to amortize the points paid over the term of the loan.
</p>

Portfolio is: Group or securities or other investments. If you invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, you can generally reduce your investment risk.

It is a preliminary step to screen your viability as a loan applicant. Pre-approval is the next step. It requires much more detail. You will need to verify your income and down payment, for instance. A lender will determine whether you meet its underwriting guidelines. A pre-approval signifies that a lender will make you a loan for the amount for which you are pre-approved.
