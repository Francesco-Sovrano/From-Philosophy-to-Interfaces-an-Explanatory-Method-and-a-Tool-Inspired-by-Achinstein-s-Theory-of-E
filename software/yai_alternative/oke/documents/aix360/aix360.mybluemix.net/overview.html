                        We hope you will use it and contribute to it to help engender <a href="http://research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/trusted-ai/" target="_blank">trust in AI</a> by making machine learning more transparent.

                        Black box machine learning models that cannot be understood by people, such as deep neural networks and large ensembles, are achieving impressive accuracy on various tasks.  However, as machine learning is increasingly used to inform high stakes decisions, explainability and interpretability of the models is becoming essential. There are many ways to explain: data vs. model, directly interpretable vs. post hoc explanation, local vs. global, static vs. interactive; the appropriate choice depends on the persona of the consumer of the explanation.

                        The AI Explainability 360 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aix360/" target="_blank">Python package</a> includes algorithms that span the different dimensions of ways of explaining along with proxy explainability metrics. The AI Explainability 360 <a href="/data">interactive demo</a> provides a gentle introduction to the concepts and capabilities by walking through an example use case from the perspective of different consumer personas. The <a href="#" onclick="switchTab('#tutorials')">tutorials</a> and other <a href="https://github.com/IBM/AIX360/blob/master/examples" target="_blank">notebooks</a> offer a deeper, data scientist-oriented introduction. The <a href="https://aix360.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">complete API</a> is also available.

                        Being a comprehensive set of capabilities, it may be confusing to figure out which class of algorithm is most appropriate for a given use case. To help, we have created some <a href="#" onclick="switchTab('#guidance')">guidance material</a> that can be consulted.
