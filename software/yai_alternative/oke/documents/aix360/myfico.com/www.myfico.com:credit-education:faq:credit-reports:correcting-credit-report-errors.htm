<h1>How do I correct errors on my credit reports?</h1>
<p>To correct errors on your credit report, you need to contact the credit bureau that is showing erroneous information. Your FICO<sup>®</sup> score uses the information on your credit reports to calculate your FICO score, so inaccurate or incorrect information on your credit report can hurt your score.</p>
<p>myFICO customers can use the following contact information to reach each bureau:</p>
<p><strong>Equifax</strong><br/><a>Equifax Disputes</a></p>
<p>All disputes with Equifax are handled online.</p>
<p><strong>Experian</strong><br/><a>Experian Disputes</a></p>
<p>All disputes with Experian are handled online.</p>
<p><strong>TransUnion</strong><br/>1-800-916-8800<br/>TransUnion Disputes<br/>2 Baldwin Place, P.O. BOX 1000<br/>Chester, PA 19022<br/><a>TransUnion Disputes</a></p>
<p>Your File Identification Number (FIN) is no longer needed by TU's system. TU's automated system may ask you for a FIN, but it is not needed to move the call forward and speak to a live agent.<br/>Here are your rights regarding information on your credit report:</p>
<p>The <a>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</a> is designed to help ensure that credit bureaus furnish correct and complete information to businesses to use when evaluating your application.</p>
<p>Your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to receive a copy of your credit report. The copy of your report must contain all of the information in your file at the time of your request.</li>
<li>You have the right to know the name of anyone who received your credit report in the last year for most purposes or in the last two years for employment purposes.</li>
<li>Any company that denies your application must supply the name and address of the credit bureau they contacted, provided the denial was based on information given by the credit bureau.</li>
<li>You have the right to a free copy of your credit report when your application is denied because of information supplied by the credit bureau. Your request must be made within 60 days of receiving your denial notice.</li>
<li>If you contest the completeness or accuracy of information in your report, you should file a dispute with the credit bureau and with the company that furnished the information to the bureau. Both the credit bureau and the furnisher of information are legally obligated to investigate your dispute.</li>
<li>You have a right to add a summary explanation to your credit report if your dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction.</li>
