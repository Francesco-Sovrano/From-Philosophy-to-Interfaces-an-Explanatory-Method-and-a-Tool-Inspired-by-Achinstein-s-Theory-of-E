<h1>How do FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores enter into the loan modification process, if at all?</h1>
<p>Your servicer will likely use your FICO Score, along with other factors, to help determine the new terms of your loan, such as your mortgage rate. In general, your FICO Score plays a key role any time you apply for new credit or change the terms of a loan. That's why staying credit savvy and maintaining a good credit rating remains so important.</p>
