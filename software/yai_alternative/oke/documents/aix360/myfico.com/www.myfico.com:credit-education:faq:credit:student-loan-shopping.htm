<h1>How do FICO scores consider student loan shopping?</h1>
<p>The growth of the student loan industry has increased public interest in how lenders assess the credit risk of young college-bound adults. Both large and small lenders often use FICO<sup>®</sup> credit scores to help them underwrite student loans. How the FICO credit scoring formulas treat credit inquiries depends on the way in which those inquiries are reported by lenders to each of the three credit bureaus. If the inquiries are reported by the lender in a manner that indicates rate shopping for a single loan (such as a mortgage, auto, or student loan), the FICO scoring formula reflects that in its calculation of your score (for a more comprehensive discussion of rate-shopping and inquiries, <a>click here</a>). In general, student loan shopping inquiries made during a focused time period (for example 30 days) will have little to no impact on your score. In the rare instance in which a credit inquiry related to a student loan is not coded so that it receives our special rate-shopping inquiry logic, that inquiry typically would decrease one's FICO score by only a few points.</p>
<p><strong>What's the best advice for people shopping for student loans so they protect their FICO scores?</strong></p>
<p>Doing a little homework first is always a good idea no matter what type of credit you're seeking. As you're shopping for the best student loan rate, the lenders you approach may request your credit report or credit score. You can generally avoid having those inquiries affect your score if you finish your rate shopping in a reasonable amount of time. That's easier if you first do your homework ahead of time and decide which companies to get quotes from. Then try to finish your rate shopping and finalize your loan within 30 days. Not only will loan rates be easier to compare when the quotes come only a few days apart, but you also will protect your FICO score.</p>
