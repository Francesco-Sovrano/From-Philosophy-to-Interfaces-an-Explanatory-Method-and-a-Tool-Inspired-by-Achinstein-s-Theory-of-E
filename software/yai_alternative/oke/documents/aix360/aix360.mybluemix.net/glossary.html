        Black box model is: A complicated model that consumers are not easily able to understand, such as a deep neural network.
    </p>

    <p>
        Classifier is: A model that predicts categorical labels from features.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consumer is: A human receiving an explanation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Directly interpretable model is: A model that consumers can usually understand, such as a simple decision tree or Boolean rule set.
    </p>

    <p>
        Disentangled representation is: A representation in which changes to one feature leave other features unchanged.
    </p>

    <p>
        Explanation is: A reason or justification for the predicted label. Some experts differentiate explanations from interpretations. Explanations come from surrogate models and interpretations come from the models themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feature is: An attribute containing information for predicting the label.
    </p>

    <p>
        Global explanation is: An explanation for an entire model.
    </p>

    <p>
        Label is: A value indicating the outcome or category for a sample.
    </p>

    <p>
        Local explanation is: An explanation for a sample.
    </p>

    <p>
        Machine learning is: A general approach for determining models from data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Modality is: The type of data, such as tabular data, images, audio signals, or natural language text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Model is: A function that takes features as input and predicts labels as output.
    </p>

    <p>
        Persona is: The role of the consumer, such as a decision maker, regulator, data scientist, or patient.
    </p>

    <p>
        Post hoc explanation is: An explanation coming from a model that approximates a black box model. The experts that differentiate the terms explanation and interpretation limit the term explanation only to post hoc explanation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prototype is: A sample that exhibits the essence of a dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
        Regressor is: A model that predicts numerical labels from features.
    </p>

    <p>
        Representation is: A mathematical transformation of data into features suitable for models.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sample is: A single data point, instance, or example.
    </p>

    <p>
        Score is: A continuous valued output from a classifier. Applying a threshold to a score results in a predicted label.
    </p>

    <p>
        Supervised learning is: Determining models from data having features and labels.
    </p>

    <p>
        Training data is: A dataset from which a model is learned.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unsupervised learning is: Determining models or representations from data having only features, no labels.
